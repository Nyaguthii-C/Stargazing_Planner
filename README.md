## Introduction
Stargazing Planner is a web application developed with the Flask framework.  
Its primary objective is to be a tool that demystifies celestial observations, catering to both novice stargazers and amateur astronomers.  
To achieves this, it leverages location data and user preferences. Users input their whereabouts and select celestial objects of interest.  
Subsequently, the app delivers two vital pieces of information. Firstly, it discerns which celestial objects are visible from the user's precise location. Secondly, it furnishes precise sky coordinates, guiding users to the exact celestial coordinates.  
It utilizes data and methods from [Astronomy API](https://astronomyapi.com/), [Sunset and sunrise times API](https://sunrise-sunset.org/api) and [pyAstronomy](https://pyastronomy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html),a collection of astronomy related packages.  
- **NOTE:** To retrieve the correct ephemeris data from the Stargazing Planner, ensure to enter the correct latitude and longitude for your location.
Entering incorrect or invalid coordinates values will return incorrect ephemeris data.
